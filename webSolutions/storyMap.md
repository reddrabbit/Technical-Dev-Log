**_This process was completed with data and workflow from the Spatial Analysis Course Project for a Least Cost Path Analysis_**

- Acquire the data required for creating a story map 
  - Includes the results of the analysis  
  -Screenshots of derived analytical surfaces 
  -Screenshots of models used to derive surfaces 
  -A web map of the study area 
- Sign into your account on [arcgis.com](https://www.arcgis.com)

- Select the ArcGIS Story Map app. 
- This will open a new window showing all story maps created.

#### Takeaway: 

+ The ArcGIS Story Map is a full stack web application depending on the type of data used within it. The web tier or presentation tier is the map series itself after it has been published by the creator. It has an interface users can interact with, either by clicking on items or just reading data off the webpage.  
+ The middle tier would be the server that goes to retrieve data that is being used by the application. Rendering the photos, maps, audio files, etcetera.  
+ The data tier would be, for items referenced from the ArcGIS Portal or ArcGIS Online, the Data store. Items like jpegs or Pngs would be referenced from a local database as these items were input from a local device
